# semantic-html

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

This project has used HTML Semantics to further the usefullness of this webpage. With the replacement of the <div> tags throughtout most of the HTML the code is now more specific than it originally was. A couple of CSS changes were needed to accomodate this such as changing the "div" tags in the css header to "nav" tags after changing it in the HTML.
